            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a tech and game enthusiast from southern Ontario, Canada. I graduated with a <b>Bachelor of Computing</b>,
                with Honours, from Queen's University in 2023, Specializing in Computer Science. I also worked alongside
                a few of my fellow graduates to create our own game development studio, <b>GnomeFire Labs</b>, and developed
                our capstone project into a fully-fledged release on Steam, <b>RaceTrap</b>, the following year.

                But there's more to me than my career. Aside from my time spent developing video games, I spend time playing
                them, too. I'm particularly fond of FPS, 4X and Rougelike games, but I've got picks in most genres that I enjoy.
                I'm also a fan of board games, card games and TCGs (Magic: The Gathering is a particularly prominent hobby of mine).

                Lastly, I'm a fairly avid music listener. None of my projects would be complete if I didn't have my tunes to
                keep me focused, and I'm often found at various rock and metal concerts, supporting both local and international artists.
                I've started a record collection of my favourite albums, and am teaching myself how to play the guitar.
