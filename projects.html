                After graduating from university, I got together with a few of my fellow graduates to create RaceTrap, a
                hybrid racing/deckbuilding PvP game. The player can take on the role of either a Racer or a Trapper, which
                have different mechanics as well as win conditions. The Racer must complete a few laps of an enclosed track,
                while the Trapper uses a deck of trap cards in order to try to prevent the Racer from finishing their laps
                in time. The game is available for free on Steam, using the link below.

                RaceTrap was created using Unity, programmed mainly in C#. My contributions to the project, in no particular order, are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was responsible for making the vehicle system in the game, including all of the driving physics, controls and features.</li>
                <li>The player's ability to unlock and customize their vehicles, using a modular car system where the components and driver
                could be changed out at will</li>
                <li>Creating a backend using Microsoft Azure, and connecting the players' inventories in the game to the backend so their
                unlocks and progress persist between devices on their account.</li>
                <li>Integrating the game into both Steamworks and Discord, allwoing for features like Rich Text display, game invites
                and game statuses on both platforms.</li>
                <li>Creating a functional matchmaking and lobby system using Steamworks and Mirror Networking</li>
                <li>Creating an in-game storefront to allow the purchase of items using game currency, as well as the option
                to purchase currency and game passes using real money in the Steam Store.</li>
            </ul>
