            <h1>RaceTrap</h1>
            <p>
                After graduating from university, I got together with a few of my fellow graduates to create RaceTrap, a
                hybrid racing/deckbuilding PvP game. The player can take on the role of either a Racer or a Trapper, which
                have different mechanics as well as win conditions. The Racer must complete a few laps of an enclosed track,
                while the Trapper uses a deck of trap cards in order to try to prevent the Racer from finishing their laps
                in time. The game is available for free on Steam, using the link below.

                RaceTrap was created using Unity, programmed mainly in C#. My contributions to the project, in no particular order, are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was responsible for making the vehicle system in the game, including all of the driving physics, controls and features.</li>
                <li>The player's ability to unlock and customize their vehicles, using a modular car system where the components and driver
                could be changed out at will</li>
                <li>Creating a backend using Microsoft Azure, and connecting the players' inventories in the game to the backend so their
                unlocks and progress persist between devices on their account.</li>
                <li>Integrating the game into both Steamworks and Discord, allwoing for features like Rich Text display, game invites
                and game statuses on both platforms.</li>
                <li>Creating a functional matchmaking and lobby system using Steamworks and Mirror Networking</li>
                <li>Creating an in-game storefront to allow the purchase of items using game currency, as well as the option
                to purchase currency and game passes using real money in the Steam Store.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                RaceTrap was awarded the <i>Queen's University 2023 Creative Computing Best Game</i> as our capstone project,
                and was presented at CHI Play 2023 where it was awarded the <i>CHI-PLAY 2023 Experimental Gameplay Award</i>.
                The game was submitted alongside our research paper on player coupling in asymmetric gameplay, which can be found below.

            <h1>Manadoku</h1>
            <p>
                Manadoku is a small website that I created, inspired by Magic: The Gathering. It's a puzzle website where each time you visit the site,
                it randomly assigns 3 columns and 3 rows of qualities that cards from Magic can have. There are 9 grid spaces, where each row and column overlap,
                and your job as the player is to name a card that has both of those two qualities. The objective is to fill in all 9 cards to win.
                In future updates, I'll be improving the style and formatting of the site, as well as adding a 'Daily Puzzle' feature so you can compare it with to your friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site, like this one, is hosted through Github Pages, and uses a Render database in order to service the requests from the site.
                Given this is a personal project site, I'm using a free Render plan and therefore <b>loading the site for the first time may take a minute to show the grid</b>.
                This behavior is normal and expected, since it receives such a low volume of traffic.

            <h1>Infinite Procedural Terrain Generator</h1>
            <p>
                I made this project with the objective of emulating randomly-generated survival games, such as Minecraft, Terraria, Factorio, etc. I created a small program which
                procedurally generates a mesh terrain, whose height is based on a number of factors which can be set by the user, and divides the resulting ground into different colours to emulate
                biomes that might appear on this terrain. The program uses a seed that can be set by the user, resulting in predictable and recreatable behavior across users. The functionality of the biome
                system could easily be extended to allow for alterations in terrain and the creation of obstacles specific to the different biomes.
